SnoozeYouLose

What and why?

Thousands of university students struggle to find a study method that works for them. They often end up developing bad studying habits, or not study at all. Procrastination is a big consequence of such an issue. With SnoozeYouLose, students can discover (and implement) many different types of studying techniques until they find the one that works best for them. 


For whom?

This program is specifically directed at university students, but can also be used by high schoolers and any person who requires an intense period of studying. It is often times university students who end up trying to use the studying habits they learned in high school, which donâ€™t end up working well as university can be quite a different environment and work load. This could help university students unlearn those bad studying habits and implement new, well-fitting ones. 

How?

This starting program focuses specifically on studying techniques that require different alarms and shutting down of specific apps or websites. The program should have, at least in its early stages, no less than 3 different studying techniques. For example, one of the techniques that could be developed for this software is the Pomodoro Technique, which requires a 25 studying period and a 5 minute break for four Pomodoro rounds. This program would have these specific alarms ready to go for as many rounds as the user requires.



Scope

This program requires implementing alarms at specific times, as well as having access to specific websites and possible applications. It does not need to have more than 3-4 different kinds of studying methods, but each methods should be unique and different to increase variety.
